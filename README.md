# TypeGraphQL API

## Overview

This project is a simple GraphQL API using **Apollo Server**, **TypeGraphQL** and **Mongoose**.
I've written this API with the objective of studying these frameworks. You have a simple Video Entity with you can Create and List.

## Installation & Running

Simply run:

```shell
> yarn
```

```shell
> yarn start
```

Server will be listening in the **port 4100**, in which you can access the Apollo Playground
__make sure that this port is available__\
